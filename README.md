# SQL-TO-POWER-BI-Dashboard Project
# Project Objectives 
Develop a dashboard for “ Jones Bike Shop “ that display key performance metrics for informed decision-making and provide a timeline for completion and recommendations on raising price next year
# Requirements:
•	Hourly Revenue Analysis
•	Profit and Revenue trends
•	Seasonal revenue
•	Rider demographics
# Recommendation
Conservative Increase: Considering the substantial increase last year, a more conservative increase might be prudent to avoid hitting a price ceiling where demand starts to drop. An increase in the range of 10-15% could test the market’s response without risking a significant loss of customers.
Price setting:
•	If the price in 2022 was $4.99 , a 10% increase would make the new price about $5.49.
•	A 15% increase would set the price at approximately $5.74.
# Recommendation Strategy:
1.	Market analysis : Conduct further market research to understand customer satisfaction, potential competitive changes , and the overall economic environment. This can guide whether leaning towards the lower or higher end of the suggested increase.
2.	Segmented Pricing Strategy: Consider different pricing for casual versus registered users, as they may have different price sensitivities.
3.	Monitor and Adjust: implement the new prices but be ready to adjust based on immediate customer feedback and sales data. Monitoring closely will allow you to fine-tune your pricing strategy without committing fully to price that might turn out to be too high
